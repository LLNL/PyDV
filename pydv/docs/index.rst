Welcome to PyDV Documentation!
************************************
The Python Data Visualizer (PyDV) is a replacement for ULTRA writtern in python. PyDV allows the presentation, manipulation, and analysis of 1D data sets, i.e. (x,y) pairs. Presentation refers to the capability to display, and make hard copies of data plots. Manipulation refers to the capability to excerpt, shift, and scale data sets. Analysis refers to the capability to combine data sets in various ways to create new data sets. 

The principal object with which PyDV works is the curve. A curve is an object which consists of an array of x values, an array of y values, a number of points (the length of the x and y arrays), and an ASCII label. PyDV operates on curves.
